Dolana is a high-performance Solana fork inspired by the open, joyful spirit of Dogecoin, rebuilt to deliver a new kind of blockchain privacy—simple, friendly, and made for everyone.
Instead of relying on heavy cryptographic systems or complex anonymity tools, Dolana introduces Friendly Privacy: a lightweight, non-intrusive protection layer that shields sensitive on-chain behavior without altering the user experience or compromising performance.

Every transaction is processed through Solana-level parallel execution, keeping the network fast, efficient, and highly scalable. But unlike traditional transparent chains, Dolana softens public visibility, reducing exposure, preventing casual tracking, and allowing users to interact without feeling watched, analyzed, or profiled.

Guided by the Dogecoin ethos, Dolana removes unnecessary barriers and embraces a culture of openness, fun, and community ownership. Privacy becomes effortless rather than technical. Participation becomes inclusive rather than exclusive. The chain remains high-speed and developer-friendly, while also being warm, approachable, and socially protective.
